  <h3>Why Numara?</h3>
</div>

<div>
  Traditional calculators slow you down with buttons, modes, and rigid workflows. Numara takes a different approach: it treats math like writing. By combining a simple text-entry interface with real-time evaluation, Numara offers a faster, more natural way to calculate.
  
  Whether you're jotting down quick arithmetic, testing formulas, or mixing notes with numbers, Numara keeps you in the flow.
